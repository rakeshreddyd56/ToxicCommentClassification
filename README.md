# ToxicCommentClassification

This project focuses on the classification of toxic comments using machine learning algorithms. Toxic comments are a major problem on online platforms and can cause harm to individuals and communities.

The project involves building a classification model using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. The dataset used for training the model contains comments labeled as toxic or non-toxic. The model is trained to predict whether a comment is toxic or not based on its content.

The performance of the model is evaluated on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project also involves hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the model.

Once the model is trained and optimized, it can be used to classify new comments in real-time on online platforms. The output of the model is a binary classification label, indicating whether the comment is toxic or non-toxic.

Overall, this project provides a useful tool for detecting and preventing toxic comments on online platforms, promoting a safer and more respectful online community.
